- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul NÃ¤ger, a philosopher of science. I have worked on the concept of matter (quantum physics), causation, ontology and digital methods in the humanities. More on my academic work on https://paulnager.org
- ðŸ‘€ This site is about my interest in applying digital methods to the humanities, especially semantic methods involving large language models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to tame large language model for precise analysis of difficult philosophical texts.  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email.
